How to handle multiple inputs

# Enum with every input type (Up, A Pressed, Start)
- Array where each slot for each item in the input enum stores a bool of that input check.
- Array for each player (1,2,3,4) that stores a copy of the input array for each one.

- Script to check an input, that takes a player number and the enum id you want to check. Uses case.
